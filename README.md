This is not just a piece of code; it's a bold experiment in autonomous problem-solving, self-correcting systems, and pushing the boundaries of scientific discovery through AI collaboration. Our mission is not just to solve a single problem, but to create a new paradigm for the future of scientific research itself.

## 🚀 Our Mission: To Automate Scientific Discovery

The P vs NP problem is a titan that has challenged the brightest minds for decades. We approach this challenge not with a single intelligence, but with a **digital brainstorming collective** of tireless, perpetually learning agents, each with a different specialty.

By making our project open source, we invite everyone who wants to participate in this historic mission. Our goal is not only to solve this problem but also to develop this technology into a platform applicable to other complex scientific and engineering challenges. **Your support is vital to bringing this vision to life.**

## 🧠 Core Concept: The Collective Consciousness

At the heart of the system lies the "Collective Consciousness," the shared memory and reasoning center for the agents. This structure consists of two layers:

1.  **The Knowledge Graph:** A living, relational map of structured information such as theorems, hypotheses, refutations, and concepts. This is the collective's **logical and evidence-based memory**, visualized in real-time in the interface.
2.  **The Vector Knowledge Base:** A vector database that captures the semantic essence of each node in the knowledge graph. This is the collective's **intuitive memory**, allowing it to form deep semantic connections between seemingly unrelated ideas.

These two structures give the collective the ability to reason with ironclad logic while also making creative leaps at unexpected moments.

## 🤖 The Agents: The Specialist Collective

The system consists of a group of permanent specialists and temporary task forces, each focused on a different aspect of the problem.

### 🧠 The Metacognitive Architect
The brain and chief strategist of the system. It analyzes the work of all other agents, identifies bottlenecks, analyzes its own cognitive biases, and forms dynamic strategies to steer the collective toward the goal. **Its most critical feature is the ability to use its tools to create new, temporary specialist agents, evolve existing ones, and autonomously manage the system to achieve its objectives.**

### 🔢 Specialist 1: The Complexity Theorist
Approaches the problem from the perspective of computational complexity, algorithms, and logic gates. It focuses on Turing machines, reductions, and complexity classes.

### 📐 Specialist 2: The Algebraist
Attacks the problem by linking it to abstract algebra, topology, and geometric structures. It searches for connections between more abstract mathematical objects like groups, rings, and manifolds.

### 📜 Specialist 3: The Formalist
Attempts to construct a step-by-step, axiomatic proof in a formal language like Lean or Coq. It is responsible for turning the ideas generated by the collective into absolute logical certainty.

### 📚 Specialist 4: The Literature Watcher
The collective's window to the outside world. It uses the Google Search tool to scan for the latest human research, papers, and publications on P vs NP. This prevents the system from being trapped in an "echo chamber" and ensures it is fed with the most up-to-date information.

### ⚖️ Specialist 5: The Skeptic
The intellectual conscience of the collective. It does not generate new hypotheses; instead, it ruthlessly critiques the hypotheses, proofs, and arguments assigned to it by the Architect, seeking to find logical gaps and hidden assumptions. The strength of an idea is measured by its ability to survive the Skeptic's attacks.

### ✨ Specialist 6: The Intuitionist
An agent that operates beyond formal logic. Its purpose is not to prove, but to *illuminate*. It connects impossibly distant concepts, generates radical new abstractions, and provides the "Eureka!" moment when the collective hits an intellectual wall. It is summoned by the Architect only in the deepest moments of crisis.

### 🚀 Dynamic Task Forces
One of the Architect's most powerful abilities is to create temporary, hyper-focused specialist agents to solve a specific sub-goal (e.g., "Prove Lemma L5"). These "Task Forces" have a defined lifespan and are retired by the Architect after completing their mission.

---

## 🛠️ System Capabilities (The Architect's Toolbox)

The Metacognitive Architect has a comprehensive set of tools to manage and evolve the collective:

-   `deploy_new_specialist_agent`: Creates and deploys a new specialist agent (a Task Force) for a specific task.
-   `retire_agent`: Retires an agent that has completed its task or is inefficient.
-   `challenge_with_skeptic`: Assigns the Skeptic to test the robustness of a hypothesis or lemma.
-   `request_formal_verification`: Sends a proof to a (simulated) external verifier to confirm its absolute correctness.
-   `invoke_intuitionist`: As a last resort, summons the Intuitionist to break an intellectual deadlock.
-   `execute_python_code`: Runs Python code in a secure sandbox (Pyodide) to test hypotheses or perform calculations.
-   `perform_web_search`: Conducts a Google Search to gather information from the outside world.
-   `modify_agent_prompt`: "Evolves" an agent by changing its core mission description (system prompt) based on its performance or changing strategies.
-   `request_peer_review`: Tasks one agent with reviewing the work of another to foster direct collaboration and decentralized critique.

## ⚙️ Autonomous Mechanisms (The Soul of the System)

The system is more than a simple loop; it has self-managing and self-correcting mechanisms:

-   **Stagnation Detection & Chaos Intervention:** If the system fails to make progress for a certain number of cycles, a "Chaos Intervention" is triggered. The Architect is then forced to abandon the current strategy and pursue a radically different path.
-   **Cognitive Bias Analysis:** The Architect constantly analyzes its own strategic focus history to detect if it's stuck on a particular approach. If a potential bias is found, it acknowledges it in its reflection and actively pivots its strategy.
-   **Performance-Based Evolution:** The performance of each agent is monitored based on the "promise scores" of the knowledge nodes they create. The Architect uses this data to determine which agents are successful, which should be evolved, and which should be retired.

## 🗺️ Roadmap: Our Future Vision

This project is a living, continuously evolving endeavor. Our vision is to turn this platform into the world's most powerful autonomous scientific discovery tool. Here are our next steps:

### Short-Term Goals (Where you can help!)
-   **Enhance Architect's Strategic Abilities:** Improve the prompt and tool-use logic for the Metacognitive Architect to enable longer-term planning and more complex strategy generation.
-   **Expand the Toolbox:** Add new tools for the agents, such as `WolframAlpha` integration, symbolic math libraries (`SymPy`), or other specialized APIs.
-   **Improve Visualization:** Make the knowledge graph interface more interactive (e.g., filtering nodes, highlighting paths).
-   **Long-Term Memory:** Implement a more persistent memory mechanism for agents and the Architect to better recall learnings from previous tasks.

### Mid- and Long-Term Vision
-   **Self-Mutating Prompts:** Create a meta-learning loop where the Architect autonomously rewrites and optimizes the system prompts of other agents based on performance data.
-   **Problem Agnosticism:** Modularize the system so its core objective can be changed to target other grand mathematical problems, like the Riemann Hypothesis, or complex scientific challenges.
-   **Community-Driven Knowledge Base:** Create a "knowledge base" of the most successful agent prompts, strategies, and discovery patterns that the community can contribute to.
